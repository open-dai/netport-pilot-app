## Description

This is a pilot application built for the [Open-DAI](http://www.open-dai.eu/) platform. Open-DAI is a EU-funded project for opening public data through a common infrastructure.

The application allows the creation of reports on a map, within [Karlshamn municipality](http://www.karlshamn.se/) in Sweden. Feel free to fork and modify the application to create something similar for another scope.

### Installation

To build and run this application you need to have node.js and bower. It also requires server access to the Open-DAI platform.

To install simply run:
```
npm install
bower install
```

To run the application:
```

```

This will build the application and launch it in your default browser.
